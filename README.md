### Supercombo input format (Full size: 799906 x float32)
#### image stream
- Two consecutive images (256 * 512 * 3 in RGB) recorded at 20 Hz : 393216 = 2 * 6 * 128 * 256
- Each 256 * 512 image is represented in YUV420 with 6 channels : 6 * 128 * 256
- Channels 0,1,2,3 represent the full-res Y channel and are represented in numpy as Y[::2, ::2], Y[::2, 1::2], Y[1::2, ::2], and Y[1::2, 1::2]
  - Channel 4 represents the half-res U channel
  - Channel 5 represents the half-res V channel
#### wide image stream
- Two consecutive images (256 * 512 * 3 in RGB) recorded at 20 Hz : 393216 = 2 * 6 * 128 * 256
- Each 256 * 512 image is represented in YUV420 with 6 channels : 6 * 128 * 256
- Channels 0,1,2,3 represent the full-res Y channel and are represented in numpy as Y[::2, ::2], Y[::2, 1::2], Y[1::2, ::2], and Y[1::2, 1::2]
  - Channel 4 represents the half-res U channel
  - Channel 5 represents the half-res V channel
##### desire
- one-hot encoded buffer to command model to execute certain actions, bit needs to be sent for the past 5 seconds (at 20FPS) : 100 * 8 traffic convention
- one-hot encoded vector to tell model whether traffic is right-hand or left-hand traffic : 2 feature buffer
- A buffer of intermediate features that gets appended to the current feature to form a 5 seconds temporal context (at 20FPS) : 99 * 512
